<b>WIP</b>

Type ```make``` to build and run

- Use Ctrl + [i, j, k, l] to move up, left, down, right
- Use Ctrl + o as Enter key
- Use Ctrl + u as Backspace
- Use Ctrl + r to read a file
- Ctrl + s to save
- ...
- Oh yes, CTRL + q quits the editor
- If anything goes wrong ```reset``` restores your terminal (even if you cant't see that you typed it)
